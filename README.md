# Healthcare SQL Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning a Synthetic healthcare dataset using **MySQL**. The dataset contains over 1,000 records of patient information, diagnoses, admissions, and more.

## Objective

To clean raw healthcare data and make it analysis-ready by removing inconsistencies, nulls, duplicates, and formatting issues using SQL.

---

##  Tasks Performed

- Tried to removed duplicate patient records using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs (No duplicate found)
- Standardized date formats with `STR_TO_DATE()`
- Filled null values with `COALESCE()` where appropriate
- Trimmed text fields and applied proper casing
